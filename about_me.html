									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>A tenacious problem solver with a dedicated result-oriented approach. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/sushil_aboutme.webp" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									Since a young age, I have been fascinated by the impact technology had on our lifestyle and our process of thinking about the world and its problems. A small but vital example of this can be seen in the way Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence has helped corporations optimize their processes, saving time, money and human efforts.
								</p>
								<p>
										With this fascination at heart, I applied for an Electronics Engineering course [Batch 2014 - 18] where I learnt the art of making machines work towards solving issues I found around me. This can be best exemplified by a small venture I had during my college years.
 								</p>
								<p>
									When I was in my first year, me and many of my classmates were plagued by the cost of course books. Our senior batches had the books but there was information gap. To bridge this gap between supply and demand, I built an ecommerce platform to facilitate the exchange of these books, at marginally lower prices than the market. I saw a problem and I built a solution around it.
 								</p>
								<p>
									Later, in 2017, I observed the problems faced by visually impaired people. Using my technology skills and understanding I built a device which harnesses the power of Computer Vision to help them gain independence. My team and I also applied for patent on the device [Application No. - 201821031503]. Description can be found <a href="drishti.html">here</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									But I quickly realized, through this journey, that I had to focus more on sustainability and scalability along with growth, which required capital and a business acumen. The essential question was how to bring an innovative product or service in the market which the people will appreciate and pay for, such that that innovation can be sustained. With that question in mind I began another journey at IIM Kashipur [Batch 2018 - 20], to learn the business behind a successful solution through my pursuit of an MBA.
								</p>
								<p>
									All the projects that I have done till now, solve a real-life problem. They have a purpose. To read more about the projects you can <a href="index.html#projects">click here</a>

									<p>Three words that define me: inquisitive, diligent and affable </p>
								</header>
 
								<p><b>Belief :</b><br>
									Asking the right questions takes priority over finding the right solutions
								</p>
 
								<p><b>Philosophy:</b><br>
									Whatever I do, wherever I work, I keep two things in mind
									<ul>
										<li>While working I am able to learn something new every day</li>
										<li>And, my work is creating an impact on user's life</li>
									</ul>
