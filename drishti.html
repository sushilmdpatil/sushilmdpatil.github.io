										Drishti is a palm-sized portable device for visually impaired people, which
										harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) based obstacle recognition to
										gain more independence by giving real-time auditory cues of the objects in front of the user.<br>

										Blindness is a disability that affects millions of people
										throughout the world. Performing everyday tasks such as driving,
										reading and walking and normal navigational tasks in the modern
										world can be a burdensome task for them. <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment">According to WHO, in 2017,</a>
										<blockquote>
											Globally, it is estimated that approximately 1.3 billion
											people live with some form of distance or near vision impairment.<br>
											With regards to distance vision, 188.5 million have mild vision impairment,
											217 million have moderate to severe vision impairment, and 36 million
											people are blind. With regards to near vision, 826 million people
											live with a near vision impairment.<br>
											Population growth and ageing will increase the risk that more people acquire vision impairment.
										</blockquote>

										Furthermore, some existing tools or obstacle detection device
										 for the visually impaired community have proven to be insufficient
										 in alerting users to all hazards and obstacles which may threaten
										 their safety, health or independence.<br>
										 If visually impaired people could carry out their day-to-day
										 activities like the people with normal vision, their chance
										 of having a better quality of life will also improve.<br>
										 To serve this noble cause and contribute to the society,
										 project Drishti was started in 2016. After overcoming multiple
										 challenges, the team has successfully built a working prototype.
									 </p>

										 <h2>How it works?</h2>
										 <p>
										 Drishti can recognise the objects in-front of the user and
										 even calculate the distance between the user and
										 the object in real-time. The output is given through
										 earphones which describes the object along with the distance.
										 For example –
										 <blockquote>
											 Example 1: “There is a dog in front, within 1 meter”
										 </blockquote>
										 <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Demo3.png" alt="Person wearing drishti and dog in front" /></a>
										 <blockquote>
											 Example 2: “There is a person in front, within 2 meters”
										 </blockquote>
										 <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Demo4.png" alt="Person wearing drishti and person in front" /></a>
										 <blockquote>
										 The device can also recognise “bicycles, birds, bottles, buses,
										 cars, cats, chairs, cows, dining tables, dogs, motorbikes,
										 people, potted plants, sofas, trains, and TV monitors”.
									 </blockquote>
									 <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/drishti_device.png" alt="drishti" /></a>
								 </p>
								 <p>
									 It can be attached on the shirt through a clip on it. It has
									 a camera in the front which needs an unobstructed view of the
									 world to take the input.
									 <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Demo5.png" alt="drishti" /></a>
									 After the input is processed the output is a voice signal given through the earphones.<br>
									 In this way Drishti is able to convert the visual environment
									 into an audible experience, helping the visually impaired people
									 to gain more independence to carry out their daily activities.
