											The objective of this project is to build a device
											that will monitor the driver’s alertness by observing
											his/her eyes and head movements. If the unit deduces
											that the driver’s eyes are drooping
											down due to sleepiness or his/her head is tilting in forward
											direction, the unit will sound an audible alarm which will
											alert the driver and he can take corrective action.

										India ranks among the top in the world in road accidents
										and death. In 2016, India witnessed over 480,000 accidents,
										resulting in over 150,000 deaths. Breaking it down further,
										on average, there are 55 accidents resulting in 17 deaths
										every hour.<br>
										Most accidents are due to driver error. The road conditions,
										vehicle maintenance, differential between vehicle speeds,
										lack of discipline by drivers and citizens all lead to high
										stress levels in drivers. The stress induces sleepiness and
										fatigue. With fatigue, the drivers are more prone to making
										error leading to a road accident.
										<br>
										Our solution aims to detect stress and sleepiness of the driver.
										It will monitor and alert the driver before it is too late. <br>
										This solution could immensely benefit the following entities
										<ul>
											<li>State Transport Corporations</li>
											<li>Commercial Vehicles carrying goods</li>
											<li>Private Fleet Owners</li>
											<li>Trains</li>
											<li>Oil / Chemical Tankers</li>
											<li>Insurance Companies</li>
										</ul>
										<h2>How it works?</h2>
										This unit can mounted in front of the driver – behind the
										steering wheel of the vehicle. It is an application which
										can run on a dedicated hardware unit. The unit will continue to silently monitor the driver.
										The unit will monitor the driver’s alertness by observing his/her eyes and head movements.
										If the unit deduces that the driver’s eyes are drooping down due to sleepiness or
										his/her head is tilting in forward direction, the unit will sound an audible alarm which will alert the driver and
										he can take corrective action.
